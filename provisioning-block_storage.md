# Ordering {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}
{: #orderingBlockStorage}

You can provision {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} and fine-tune to meet your capacity and performance needs. Get the most out of your storage with two options for specifying performance.
{: shortdesc}

- You can provision with **Endurance** tiers that feature pre-defined performance levels to fit workloads that don't have well-defined performance requirements.
    - **0.25 IOPS per GB** is designed for workloads with low I/O intensity. These workloads are typically characterized by having a large percentage of data inactive at a time. Example applications include storing mailboxes or departmental-level file shares.
    - **2 IOPS per GB** is designed for most general-purpose usage. Example applications include hosting small databases that are backing web applications or virtual machine disk images for a hypervisor.
    - **4 IOPS per GB** is designed for higher-intensity workloads. These workloads are typically characterized by having a high percentage of data active at a time. Example applications include transactional and other performance-sensitive databases.
    - **10 IOPS per GB** is designed for the most demanding workloads such as those created by NoSQL databases, and data processing for Analytics. This tier is available in [all data centers](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-selectDC) for storage that is provisioned up to 4 TB.
- You can fine-tune your storage to meet specific performance requirements and build a high-powered **Performance** environment by specifying the total number of input/output operations per second (IOPS). The available **custom** IOPS range depends on the volume capacity. The following table shows the available IOPS ranges based on volume size.

     | Volume size (GB) | IOPS range |
     |-------------|-----------------|
     | 10 - 39     | 100 - 1,000 |
     | 40 - 79     | 100 - 2,000 |
     | 80 - 99     | 100 - 4,000 |
     | 100 - 499   | 100 - 6,000 |
     | 500 - 999   | 100 - 10,000|
     | 1,000 - 1,999 | 100 - 20,000|
     | 2,000 - 2,999 | 200 - 40,000|
     | 3,000 - 3,999 | 200 - 48,000|
     | 4,000 - 7,999 | 300 - 48,000|
     | 8,000 - 9,999 | 500 - 48,000 |
     | 10,000 - 12,000 | 1,000 - 48,000 |

## Ordering {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} in the UI
{: #orderingthroughConsole}
{: ui}

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/catalog){: external}, and click **Storage**. Then, select **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}**, and click **Create**.
2. Select your deployment location (region, location, zone).
   - Ensure that the new Storage is added in the same location as the Compute host or hosts that you have.
3. Billing. You can choose between Monthly or Hourly Billing.
   - With **hourly** billing, the number of hours the block LUN existed on the account is calculated at the time the LUN is deleted or at the end of the billing cycle. Which ever comes first. Hourly billing is a good choice for storage that is used for a few days or less than a full month.
   - With **monthly** billing, the calculation for the price is pro-rated from the date of creation to the end of the billing cycle and billed immediately. If a block LUN is deleted before the end of the billing cycle, the difference is not refunded. Monthly billing is a good choice for storage that is used in production workloads that use data that needs to be stored and accessed for long periods of time (month or longer).

4. Enter your storage size in the **Size** field.
5. Select the size of the Snapshot space from the list.

   This space is in addition to your usable space. For snapshot space considerations and recommendations, read [Ordering Snapshots](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-orderingsnapshots).
   {: tip}

6. Choose your **OS Type** from the list.

   This selection is based on the operating system that your host is running on and it cannot be modified later. For example, if your server is Ubuntu or RHEL, select Linux&reg;. If your host is a Windows 2012 or Windows 2016 server, select the Windows 2008+ option from the list. For more information about various Windows options, see the [FAQ](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-block-storage-faqs#windowsOStypes).
   {: tip}

7. Select your IOPS profile. You can choose between the predefined values of **Endurance (Tiers)** or enter your custom IOPS value for **Performance**.
8. In the side panel, review your order summary, and apply your Promo Code if you have one.

   Discounts are applied when the order is processed.
   {: note}

9. Acknowledge that you reviewed the terms and conditions by checking the appropriate box.
10. Click **Create**. Your new storage allocation is available in a few minutes.

{: api}

The method `order_block_volume` (storage_type, location, size, os_type, iops=None, tier_level=None, snapshot_size=None, service_offering='storage_as_a_service', hourly_billing_flag=False) places an order for a block volume.

For a successful order, you must specify the following parameters:
- `storage_type` – ‘performance’ or ‘endurance’
- `location` – Datacenter in which to order iSCSI volume
- `size` – Size of the volume, in GB
- `os_type` – OS Type to use for volume alignment, see help for list
- `iops` – Number of IOPS for a “Performance” order
- `tier_level` – Tier level to use for an “Endurance” order
- `snapshot_size` – The size of optional snapshot space, if snapshot space is also ordered (None if not ordered)
- `service_offering` – Requested offering package to use in the order (‘storage_as_a_service’, ‘enterprise’, or ‘performance’)
- `hourly_billing_flag` – Billing type, monthly (False) or hourly (True), default to monthly.

## Disaster recovery considerations
{: #DRconsiderations}

To avoid data-loss and to ensure business continuity, consider replicating your servers and storage in another data center. Replication keeps your data in sync in two different locations based on your snapshot schedule. For more information, see [Replicating data](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-replication).

If you want to clone your volume and use it independently from the original volume, see [Creating and managing duplicate volumes](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-duplicatevolume).

## Identifying {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} on your invoice
{: #LUNonInvoice}

All LUNs appear on your invoice as a line item. Endurance appears as “Endurance Storage Service” and Performance appears as "Performance Storage Service" The rate varies based on your storage level. You can expand on Endurance or Performance to see that it's {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}.
