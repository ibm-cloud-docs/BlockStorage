# Managing storage limits

By default, you can provision a combined total of 250 {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volumes globally. 

You can request a limit increase by submitting a ticket in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. When the request is approved, you get a volume limit that is set for a specific data center.  

To request a limit increase, open a ticket and direct it to your sales representative.

In the ticket, provide the following information:

- **Ticket Subject**: Request to Increase Data Center Volume Count Storage Limit

- **What is the use case for the additional volumes request?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to a new VMware datastore, a new development and testing (dev/test) environment, an SQL database, or logging.*

- **How many extra Block volumes are needed by type, size, IOPS, and location?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "25x Endurance 2 TB @ 4 IOPS in DAL09" or "25x Performance 4 TB @ 2 IOPS in WDC04".*

- **How many extra File volumes are needed by type, size, IOPS, and location?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "25x Performance 20 GB @ 10 IOPS in DAL09" or "50x Endurance 2 TB @ 0.25 IOPS in SJC03".*
 
- **Provide an estimate of when you expect/plan to provision all of the requested volume increase.** <br />
 "*For example, your answer might be something similar to "90 days".*

- **Provide a 90-day forecast of expected average capacity usage of these volumes.** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "expect 25 percent to be used in 30 days, 50 percent to be used in 60 days and 75 percent to be used in 90 days".*

A response to all of the above questions is required. You'll be notified of the update to your limits through the ticket process.
